# Build a Basic Image Classification Model using a Pre-Trained Neural Network

## Internship Project

This project is part of my internship, where I explore the implementation of an image classification model using a pre-trained neural network. The goal is to leverage transfer learning to efficiently classify images into predefined categories.

## Project Overview

- **Model Used:** A pre-trained deep learning model (e.g. MobileNetV2)
- **Dataset:** A dataset of categorized images for training and evaluation
- **Frameworks & Tools:** TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV
- **Training Approach:** Fine-tuning a pre-trained model on the given dataset
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report

## Features
- Uses a pre-trained model for feature extraction and classification
- Fine-tunes the model on a specific dataset
- Visualizes training progress and performance metrics
- Allows predictions on new images

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

# Run the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook mindshift_internship.ipynb
```

## Usage
- Open the notebook and execute the cells sequentially.
- Upload custom images for classification.
- Modify hyperparameters for experimentation.

## Results
The model achieves satisfactory accuracy in classifying images and can be further optimized for better performance.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different pre-trained models
- Increase dataset size for better generalization
- Deploy the model as a web application
